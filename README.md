The code of the paper ‘Hyperspectral image super-resolution network based on cross-scale non-local attention’.(TGRS)

The fusion between the hyperspectral and multi-spectral images could be conducted by running the ‘main_hmfusion.py’.

The fusion between the hyperspectral and PAN images could be conducted by running the ‘main_hpfusion.py’.

Note that the main network difference between these two fusion taks is the training strategy, including optimizer, training epochs.
